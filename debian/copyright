    Hi Ulrich,

    Thank you for checking with us - I can confirm that the header
    files you list are indeed under a free to use license and you may
    integrate them to your project.

    Your application sounds intriguing.  The OpenCL working group is
    looking to outreach to selected developers on a private email
    feedback list.  I think the group would be interested in your
    input feedback on OpenCL functionality and the OpenCL ICD
    mechanism that is under construction.

    Would you be interested in providing feedback to the OpenCL group
    directly?  If so I can help in setting up the logistics to make
    that possible.

    Best regards,

    Neil

    Subject: Permission to use OpenCL header files in open source project

    Dear Sir or Madam,

    I am seeking your advice and kind permission to use and distribute your OpenCL 
    header files with an open source project called "Darktable".

    Darktable is a photography workflow solution for Linux with a virtual 
    lighttable and darkroom. Its main focus and strength is in conversion and 
    development of photographic RAW-files. Details can be found at 
    http://darktable.sourceforge.net. Darktable is distributed in source code and 
    binary form under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENCE (GPL) Version 3 
    (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)

    Darktable already supports OpenCL functionality in various parts. As a 
    consequence it is running with blazing speed at many typical processing steps 
    making it the best open-source raw converter available. It could be a perfect 
    advocate for the benefits of GPU computing as provided by OpenCL and help 
    propagate the idea.

    Darktable's current limitation lies in the fact that a working OpenCL 
    development kit is required at compile time. The resulting binary will only 
    run on systems which have a working OpenCL run-time environment. As Linux 
    software distributions can not rely on this, they will have to ship darktable 
    binaries with OpenCL deactivated, thus preventing wide spread use of OpenCL.

    My goal is to modify Darktable in a way, that it is able to detect the 
    presence of OpenCL at run-time. I will use wrapper functions and dynamic 
    loading to accomplish this. At startup Darktable would search for an existing 
    OpenCL library and bind it if present. This way I would take advantage of the 
    fact that many system already have a working OpenCL runtime library provided 
    by a proprietary graphics card driver. That is the case e.g. for NVIDIA.

    In order to do so, I need to include OpenCL specifications in form of  header 
    files into Darktable's source code, namely the following files from your 
    OpenCL API registry (http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl):

	    opencl.h
	    cl_platform.h
	    cl.h
	    cl_ext.h
	    cl_d3d10.h
	    cl_gl.h
	    cl_gl_ext.h
	    cl.hpp

    All with Version 1.0 or Version 1.1. depending on final implementation.

    I understand the licensing terms in the preambles of your header files in the 
    way that Khronos Group grants all third parties the right to use, copy, 
    modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the 
    material as long as the copyright notice and permission notice in the preamble 
    is included.

    I would be indebted if you could confirm to me that my understanding in right 
    and that I am allowed to include the above mentioned files into Darktables 
    source tree, which is distributed under GPL.

    With best regards,

    Ulrich Pegelow
